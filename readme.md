# AI Integration:
The platform utilizes the Llama3.2 AI model to generate email content. The idea is provided as a prompt to the AI, which then generates both the subject line and email body dynamically based on the given input. This integration helps streamline the content creation process and allows users to quickly generate professional email drafts for their campaigns.

# Known Limitations or Assumptions
- AI Content Generation:
The quality and relevance of the generated subject line and email body depend on the clarity and specificity of the input prompt. Vague or ambiguous descriptions might lead to less relevant outputs. The model might not always generate perfectly tailored content, and manual adjustments might still be necessary.

- Email Delivery: 
The email delivery system relies on external service (Gmail) and could face limitations in terms of send volume, rate limits, or blocked emails due to poor sender reputation.

- File Format Validation:
The system assumes that uploaded CSV files are formatted correctly. Invalid files (e.g., missing required fields or improper formatting) will lead to errors during the upload process.

- Internet Connectivity:
The AI model and email service integrations require a stable internet connection for generating content and sending emails.
